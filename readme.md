# üß† Quantum Mindfulness Ontology

- A formal ontology of the Quantum Mindfulness framework's Prime Modality. This version uses OWL restrictions to define relationships at the class level, ensuring a robust and machine-readable structure.
- A formal ontology of the psychodynamic architecture of consciousness as detailed in the Quantum Mindfulness source material. This model defines the sequential process from Observation to the emergence of a final Mental State, and the mechanism of Belief Formation.
- An ontology of the Quantum Mindfulness framework. Note: While some source texts refer to eleven dimensions, the detailed enumeration consistently lists ten (Pd1-Pd10). The concept of 'eleven' may allude to a foundational 'Psycho-Volitional core' that underpins the ten enumerable dimensions.

## üß≠ Overview

This ontology models the **formal psychodynamic architecture** underlying the Quantum Mindfulness framework. Unlike classical mindfulness approaches that emphasize passive observation and equanimity, Quantum Mindfulness focuses on **active structural transformation** of mental phenomena, perception, and inherent bias.

The ontology defines core concepts, structures, and processes that enable advanced cognitive operations such as:

- Active reframing of experience
- Modification of cognitive-affective bias (`Bias_M1`)
- Engagement with Prime Modality dimensions (Pd1‚ÄìPd3)
- Transformation of perceptual architecture

### üåê Bilingual Capability

As of version 1.0.0, this ontology includes full Spanish-language support. All core labels, definitions, and comments are available in both English (`@en`) and Spanish (`@es`). This makes the ontology suitable for cross-linguistic semantic applications, multilingual education, and accessible AI interpretation in both languages.

### üß† Use with NotebookLM and AI Assistants

This ontology is optimized for conceptual exploration, visual reasoning, and multi-modal interpretation in tools like NotebookLM, ChatGPT, and Gemini. Its size and structure make it ideal for semantic navigation and theory testing.

The ontology‚Äôs bilingual structure supports querying and analysis in both English and Spanish. When NotebookLM is set to Spanish output mode, it will preferentially interpret and summarize using the `@es` language annotations.

#### üìö How to Use in NotebookLM
1.	Upload [**chatbot_primer.md**](chatbot_primer.md) into the file selection panel.
2.	Use structured, comparative, or exploratory prompts to query the ontology‚Äôs logic.

#### üîç Suggested Prompts

- ‚ÄúList and describe all ten psychodynamic dimensions.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúHow does the ontology define and apply the concept of Bias_M1?‚Äù
- ‚ÄúExplain the cognitive role of Pd2 in restructuring subjective meaning.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúHow does the Reframing Process alter the Prime Modality?‚Äù
- ‚ÄúIn what ways does this ontology differ from classical mindfulness models?‚Äù
- ‚ÄúWhat structural mechanism links Valence(Œ®) to overall perception?‚Äù

#### üåê Visual Mind Maps

A mind map derived from the ontology is included (mindmap.svg) to assist in:
* Navigating complex class hierarchies at a glance 
* Identifying semantic depth (up to 5 levels in current model)
* Bridging ontology structure to conceptual grouping

This is particularly useful in:
* Education / teaching modules
*  Live workshop explanation
* LM visual context anchoring (when paired with .ttl)

‚∏ª

#### üîä Audio Overviews and Narrative Exports

AI narration tools (e.g. ElevenLabs, LM audio chains) can generate audio walk-throughs of the ontology. You can:
* Create dimension-by-dimension narrations (e.g. ‚ÄúPd1: Psycho-Volitional Dynamics‚Äù)
* Record module overviews for individual branches
* Stitch segments into a semantic podcast for immersive review or publication

This enhances cognitive retention and supports alternative learning modes‚Äîespecially useful for theory incubation, reflection, and pedagogy.
